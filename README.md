# Patient Records Dashboard

Hey there, this is my Patient Records Dashboard project made with React.  
Itâ€™s a simple app where you can see patients, search them, and check their details.  

## Features

I tried to include stuff like  
- Home page with header and navigation  
- Patients page that shows a list in cards  
- Search bar to find patients by name  
- Click on a patient to see details in a popup modal  
- Add a new patient (only in the app, no backend)  
- Works on mobile and desktop  
- Shows loading and error messages when fetching data
